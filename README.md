# Place 2.0

An opensource place alternative, made by [Dynastic Development](https://dynastic.co). Join our [discord](https://discord.gg/CgC8FTg). I'm aware of other clones, but this is going to be much better than the original :).

## Getting started

* Install MongoDB
* Rename config/config.example.js to config/config.js
    * You'll need a strong secret
* Run `npm i` to install dependencies
* Finally, run `node app.js`
